# AutoSDF
- This module is the implementation of 3D reconstruction task, mostly borrowed from [AutoSDF](https://github.com/yccyenchicheng/AutoSDF). We modify the first decoder that maps 2D features to 3D features and train it from scratch. We leverage the other two pre-trained decoders to incorporate shape priors and perform quantized decoding.
